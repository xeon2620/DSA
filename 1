Method:
writing a fuction inside a class is called method.
Method Statement:
-Declaration
-Defination
-Calling
Declaration and defination should be outside main class.
Calling should be inside main class , inside main method.

Syntax:-
Function Type Func Name(Paramert){
     Declaration
     Defination
}

Function Types:-
Except void for remaining we have to return the data,
For void we have to print the data
Except void remaining all data types , those having some default values,that is why we have to return values and 
Void is not a data type ,that is why not to return values

class Main(){
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Hello World");
    }
}


Creating A Scanner class:
import java.util.Scanner;
class Person{
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    int a=sc.nextInt();
}
class Main{
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        System.out.print(a);
        
    }
    
}
Before Scanner Class we have string buffer will only accepts strings, later you have to convert into targeted data types.We can't convert for multiple times thats why scanner class comes in.
In Scanner class we have multiple predefined method just creating an object for scanner class you can take value.


Creating A Scanner class:
import java.util.Scanner;
class Person{
    void call()
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.print(a);
    }
    
}
class Main{
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        
        Person obj =  new Person();
        obj.call();
    }
    
}

Create a class using class keyword and name of the class the starting letter of class should be capital and bracket is optional.
For all the methods the name of the method should be small.
Fibonacci.
