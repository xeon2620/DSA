Static block and Constructor:
Constructor are noting but they used to initialize the object.
For every class there will be a default constructor,whenever we create object constructor will be called than object will be created.
Constructor having class name for method properties.
EX:- we created 2 objects 2 times constructor will be called:

public class q2{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Demo d1 = new Demo();
        Demo d2 = new Demo();
    }
}
class Demo{
    static{
        System.out.println("Static Block");
        
    }
    Demo(){
        System.out.println("Constructor");
    }
}
