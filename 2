Static block and Constructor:
Constructor are noting but they used to initialize the object.
For every class there will be a default constructor,whenever we create object constructor will be called than object will be created.
Constructor having class name for method properties.
EX:- we created 2 objects 2 times constructor will be called:

public class q2{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Demo d1 = new Demo();
        Demo d2 = new Demo();
    }
}
class Demo{
    static{
        System.out.println("Static Block");
        
    }
    Demo(){
        System.out.println("Constructor");
    }
}

static block will be created with the static keyword.it will call automatically no need to call with later object or class

static method
for static method no need to call with object you can directly call with class name and here static will act as instance or object
